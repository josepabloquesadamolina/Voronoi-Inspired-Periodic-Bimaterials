# Assessing the Accuracy of a DL-Based Inverse Design Framework for Voronoi-Inspired Periodic Bimaterials

## Highlights

• Developed a DL-based inverse design framework for composite materials.<br />
• Integrated GAN and CNN to improve material discovery and design processes.<br />
• Analyzed data effects on NN interpolation and extrapolation accuracy.<br />
• Improved predictions using GAN-generated samples in the CNN training.<br />
• Assessed training data composition impact on DL-based framework’s accuracy across design spaces.<br />
