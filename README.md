# Assessing the Accuracy of a DL-Based Inverse Design Framework for Voronoi-Inspired Periodic Bimaterials

## Highlights

• Developed a DL-based inverse design framework for composite materials.
• Integrated GAN and CNN to improve material discovery and design processes.
• Analyzed data effects on NN interpolation and extrapolation accuracy.
• Improved predictions using GAN-generated samples in the CNN training.
• Assessed training data composition impact on DL-based framework’s accuracy across design spaces.
